<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intrauterine Coil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hormonal type</li><li>Copper type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intrauterine coil market consists of two primary types: hormonal and copper. Hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs) release hormones, primarily progestin, which thicken cervical mucus and prevent ovulation, offering effective long-term contraception. Copper IUDs, on the other hand, utilize copper ions to create a hostile environment for sperm, preventing fertilization without hormones. Both types are popular for their effectiveness, convenience, and long duration of action, catering to diverse contraceptive needs and preferences among users.</p></p>
