<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hearing Screening Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>OAE Hearing Screening Equipment</li><li>ABR Hearing Screening Equipment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The hearing screening equipment market includes two primary types: Otoacoustic Emissions (OAE) hearing screening equipment and Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) hearing screening equipment. OAE equipment detects sound waves produced by the inner ear, assessing cochlear function, making it ideal for newborn and infant screenings. In contrast, ABR equipment measures the brain's response to auditory stimuli, providing insights into auditory pathways and brainstem function, suitable for a broader range of ages and conditions. Both play vital roles in early hearing detection and intervention.</p></p>
