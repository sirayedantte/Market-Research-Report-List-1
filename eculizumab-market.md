<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eculizumab Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plasma Exchange</li><li>Plasma Infusion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody used primarily for treating conditions like atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and well as other complement-mediated disorders. The market for Eculizumab can be segmented into two main types: Plasma Exchange and Plasma Infusion. </p><p>Plasma Exchange involves the removal of patients' blood plasma, replacing it with donor plasma or a substitute, effectively reducing harmful antibodies and autoimmune compounds. In contrast, Plasma Infusion directly administers donor plasma to patients, enhancing immune response and alleviating symptoms. Both methods aim to improve patient outcomes by modulating immune responses associated with Eculizumab therapy.</p></p>
