<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Knee Prosthesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bone Cement Fixation Prosthesis</li><li>Biological Fixation Prosthesis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The knee prosthesis market primarily includes two types: bone cement fixation prosthesis and biological fixation prosthesis. Bone cement fixation prosthesis utilizes acrylic cement to secure the implant to the bone, providing immediate stability and facilitating quick recovery. In contrast, biological fixation prosthesis encourages natural bone integration through porous surfaces, allowing the bone to grow into the implant over time, which can lead to improved long-term stability but may involve a longer rehabilitation period. Both types cater to different patient needs and preferences.</p></p>
